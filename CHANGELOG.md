# SecurePass - Recent Updates & Improvements

## ✅ Completed Changes (June 2, 2025)

### 📚 Documentation Consolidation
- **Merged QUICKSTART.md into README.md**: All documentation is now in a single comprehensive file
- **Enhanced README.md**: Added detailed sections for installation, usage, troubleshooting, security practices, and more
- **Removed QUICKSTART.md**: Content fully integrated into main documentation

### 🌙 Dark Mode Improvements
- **Real-time theme switching**: Themes now apply immediately without requiring application restart
- **Enhanced theme application**: Added `apply_theme_to_widget()` method for recursive theme application to all UI elements
- **Persistent theme preferences**: Theme selection is now saved and loaded automatically
- **Improved settings dialog**: Added both "Apply" and "Save" buttons for better user control

### ⚙️ Settings Enhancements
- **"Save Settings" button**: Fully functional settings persistence system
- **User preferences system**: Added `save_user_preferences()` and `load_user_preferences()` methods
- **Configuration file**: Settings stored in `user_config.json` for persistence across sessions
- **Real-time preview**: Theme changes can be previewed with "Apply" before saving

### 🧹 Cleanup & Organization
- **Removed demo files**: Deleted `demo.py` and `verify_setup.py` to clean up the workspace
- **Streamlined file structure**: Focus on core application files only
- **Updated file references**: All documentation updated to reflect current file structure

### 💾 Auto-Export on Logout
- **Automatic backup creation**: Passwords are automatically exported when closing the application
- **File overwriting**: Auto-backup file (`auto_backup_latest.spx`) is overwritten each time for consistency
- **Timestamped backups**: Added option for manual timestamped backups that won't be overwritten
- **Smart export logic**: Only creates backups when passwords exist and user is logged in
- **Non-blocking operation**: Auto-export doesn't prevent application closing if it fails

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better exception handling throughout the application
- **Improved code structure**: Better separation of concerns and method organization
- **Configuration management**: Centralized settings with fallback defaults
- **Theme system overhaul**: More robust theme switching with comprehensive widget coverage
